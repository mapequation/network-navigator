# CLAUDE.md

Network Navigator 2.0: Vite + React 19 + TS + HeroUI 3 + MobX, rendered with `@mapequation/d3gl`.
Scripts: `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build` (tsc + vite), `pnpm test` (vitest), `pnpm e2e` (Playwright), `pnpm lint` (biome).
Git: `gh` resolves to the upstream v1 repo here, so always pass `-R mapequation/network-navigator`. Worktrees go
under `.claude/worktrees/`.

## Developing d3gl alongside the app

Most rendering, layout and LOD work belongs in **d3gl**, not in this app. The library is a separate repo at
`../d3gl` (`/Users/daniel/dev/projects/icelab/code/web/d3gl`, GitHub `mapequation/d3gl`, so pass
`-R mapequation/d3gl` to `gh`). The package itself is `../d3gl/packages/d3gl`.

- **Read `../d3gl/CLAUDE.md`, and the `../d3gl/AGENTS.md` it imports, before any d3gl work**: changing it,
  judging its PRs or measurements, or asking the user about them. It is outside this working directory, so
  Claude Code does not load it automatically. Its rules apply in full: performance at ≈1M with LOD off and on,
  per-frame regression tests, and "uncertain means blocking". Every prompt that delegates d3gl work to an agent
  must say to read that file in full and follow all of it.
- **Linking a local d3gl build** into the app, instead of the published package:
  1. Work in a d3gl worktree (`../d3gl/.claude/worktrees/<name>`) and build it:
     `pnpm --filter @mapequation/d3gl build` (tsdown into `packages/d3gl/dist`). The app imports `dist`, not
     `src`, so rebuild after every library change, then reload the page.
  2. In this app: `pnpm add @mapequation/d3gl@link:<worktree>/packages/d3gl`.
  3. In `vite.config.ts`: add the worktree path to `server.fs.allow`, next to `searchForWorkspaceRoot(process.cwd())`,
     and set `optimizeDeps: { exclude: ["@mapequation/d3gl"] }` so Vite serves the rebuilt `dist` instead of a
     pre-bundled copy.
- **Back to the published package:** `master` never carries a `link:` dependency. After the d3gl changes are
  merged and released (the Version Packages PR; a release needs the user's go-ahead), run
  `pnpm add @mapequation/d3gl@^<version>`, remove the `fs.allow` entry and the `optimizeDeps` exclusion, run
  `pnpm build`, `pnpm test` and `pnpm e2e`, and then merge to `master`.
- **Data:** never fabricate links, flows or values. Render only what the input has.
