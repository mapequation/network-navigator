# Network Navigator

Interactive navigator for hierarchical (Infomap) networks, built on
[@mapequation/d3gl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mapequation/d3gl).
Published under `/navigator2`; part of [mapequation.org](https://www.mapequation.org).

## Features

- Zoomable "map of networks": the Infomap hierarchy drives an adaptive
  level-of-detail cut (d3gl); double-click a module to zoom into it.
- Loads `.ftree` files, raw networks (Pajek/edge list, `*States`), and
  `.tree`/`.clu` partitions (flow computed by Infomap, optionally `--no-infomap`).
- Runs [Infomap](https://www.mapequation.org/infomap/) in the browser to
  cluster raw networks; opens results from Infomap Online.
- Export ftree, SVG, PNG.

## Development

pnpm + Vite + React + TypeScript. `pnpm install`, then:

- `pnpm dev` — dev server at `/navigator2/`
- `pnpm test` / `pnpm lint` / `pnpm build`

Deployed to GitHub Pages by `.github/workflows/pages.yml` on push to `master`.
